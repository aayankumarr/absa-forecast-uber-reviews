"It is a cheating app. While booking the ride it shows as 400 rupees and it increases to 680 while dropping. Because of this, conflict is being created between drivers and us. There was no traffic also. Its their trick to choose their platform when compared to others like ola or rapido. I suggest everyone to prefer ola or rapido. Because their price is fixed and it will not vary like uber's",driver,neutral,

Even single star is waste... Driver will not lift the call and they won't reply and for cancelation again they will charge on us.... I wait upto 10min and called driver and I cancelled and I got cancelation fee.. This is second time and I'm not going to use it at all,driver,neutral,

"Great drivers. I couldn't set time. I set 1:00 pm but time confirmed wrong. Tried 3 times. Was able to cancel 1. I called first two at number shown. Phone showed Ontario then BC and neither answered. Finally lady called me, told her my problems. Said she would call Uber so I wasn't charged. Said I would take a cab. Said no, she'd tell them I need 1:00 pm pick up. Nobody came, so guess she didn't. Hope she did call Uber about wrong times. Will try to set time one more trip.",driver,neutral,
Good in USA but lots of issues when traveling. I'm living in South America for an extended amount of time and the drivers only want to be paid in cash. They get frustrated if you pay in card even if you tip generously and they will give you 1 star reviews for this. UBER please tell drivers the payment method of the rider and do not allow drivers to give fake reviews to riders. My rider rating has absolutely plummeted from 1 star reviews from this trip alone.,driver,neutral,

Drivers don't turn up and go in opposite directions. They clearly use Bolt and choose not to cancel trips. I've taken over 130 Ubers and had the same issue for years in several countries. The automated in-app support just says that you're not charged. They don't punish drivers or compensate users for their inability to get a grip on the problem,driver,neutral,

4 days ago I requested a cash trip for my mom. The driver was given cash but I still had the amount owing on my account. This amount which was already paid affected my next trip which resulted in me having to settle it before I could request a trip. I paid for a single trip twice.
